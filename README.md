## Development Setup

Resource Creator is built with [Wails](https://wails.app), a Go framework for desktop applications, and features a
modern frontend powered by Vite and React.

### Live Development

For rapid development and testing:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run:

    ```bash
    wails dev
    ```
   This command:
    - Launches a Vite development server with fast hot-reloading for frontend changes.
    - Starts a dev server on http://localhost:34115 to allow direct interaction with your Go backend methods via your
      browserâ€™s devtools.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready distributable:

```bash
wails build
```

This command compiles the application into a standalone package for redistribution.
